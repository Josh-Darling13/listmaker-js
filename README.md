# listmaker-js

Listmaker Plus is a Javascript-based desktop application designed to meta code. Currently, it writes HTML, CSS, Javascript, and some basic Python. Soon, I'll expand it to include React, JSX, Node.js, C/C++, PHP, etc. In upcoming versions, downloadable templates of prewritten code will be available. I designed it to be functional and look good. It has an animated header and a fully animated background. 

I wrote this program for myself. Since I only code on my computer, I designed this desktop first. Versions for mobile and tablet screen sizes are in development.
